### Hardworking & Ambition-driven | Aspiring AI-Enhanced iOS Developer
I'm an iOS developer with a Computer Information Systems A.S.S. degree from New York City College of Technology, CUNY.

I believe in **"lifting while climbing,"** building great apps. I focus on bridging the gap between backend logic and elegant user interfaces, always staying curious about the latest innovations in LLMs and mobile architecture.
